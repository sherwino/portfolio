        Professionally working as a full stack developer for an international
        company that is building a framework for media companies to get their
        content on as many screens as possible. Every day is a learning
        experience when you are working with various platforms and their niche
        developement processes. Overall, it has been a rewarding experience and
        am extremely grateful for the opportunity. Currently residing in South
        Florida (Little Havana to be exact) and have no plans of leaving this
        city for the time being.
