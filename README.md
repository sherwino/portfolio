## sherwino.co

A little portfolio site built using vanilla js, basic html, and css.
Some of the data is coming from a Firebase Realtime DB, and the static assets are hosted on using Firebase Hosting.

Wanted to use some experimental syntax like optional chaining so I had to integrate Babel to transpile all of the code in the `src` folder to minified browser compliant code.

I do enjoy the simplicity of the site as is but I do have a wishlist of things that I would like to add, basically an excuse to practice some principals I haven't been able to use or apply in quite sometime.

Wishlist:

- [ ] Get a perfect score with lighthouse, not far from this but hopefully using firebase and google fonts doesn't get in the way of this perfect score.
- [ ] Finish making site into a true PWA, let user know when there are updates to the site.
- [ ] Chat integration, use the same one from react taskbar
- [ ] Use AVIF, right now I am using webp, webm, and svgs but lets see if we could optimize by using AVIF.
- [ ] Use gif in platforms that do not support webm.
- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Use localization, and present the information in Spanish, Portuguese, and French.
- [ ] Use UserAgent info to present feedback to the user based off of the browser and more.
- [ ] Create tools.sherwino.co subdomain, and build a suite of tools that I really would like to build out. That deserves a whole markdown file of its own.
- [ ] Use CSS variables, so that I could properly theme throughout the site and its subdomains
- [ ] Create a react, vue, angular, mthrill, svelte version of the site with subdomains, maybe let the user select this in the footer.
- [ ] Add filtering, so that when a user clicks on a language or tech the projects we highlight projects that are related to that tech.
- [ ] Maybe I shouldn't use VW for sizing because fonts jumping and moving around is not a good look, maybe snapping is better.
- [ ] Create a print / download resume button using extended data from firebase
- [ ] Try building some of the tools in webassembly, cause why not
- [ ] Analytics would be nice, either google analytics, or something of the sort to know who is looking for me.
