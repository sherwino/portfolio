                            This corporate site was built using the popular Content Management System (CMS) Wordpress 4.8.1, and a MySQL 5.6.32 database. The site utilizes 
                            HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES5, and PHP5.6. Most of the content was uploaded using Filezilla SFTP client to the Apache Linux webserver. 
                            Now one of the issues building this company site was related to the fact that it was on a shared host. In order to optimize the load times
                            went ahead and set up Amazon Cloudfront CDN to host all of the static content and take some load off the server. The site is also being cached
                            using WPFC. Small edits to the photos done in Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and Gimp. The game is currently being refactored to utilize more ES6.

                            Project Man was designed to solve a simple problem at my old company. The company had been using Excel to log
                            and keep track of projects. While Excel can be an extremely powerful tool, it is not designed to be collaborative.
                            You can share files, and you can have multiple people editing at once but there is barely any accountability. In Excel 
                            it is also is difficult to keep track of all of the changes, and who made them. If you don't constantly protect
                            the workbook people collaborating can accidentally shift cells and modify the spreadsheet and in ways that can lead to
                            several issues. The web app was designed in Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple CRUD
                            application that will let only authorized users make changes, and it will show additional informationt to administrators.
                            The site is currently hosted on Heroku, and utilizes mLabs to host the NoSQL database. The site is still a work in progress.

                            microReviews is a conceptual site that I built part of my final project over at Ironhack. This is a consumer review site where we can gather positive and
                            negative data form simple components that make up a products. For instance a volume button on a mobile phone. Do people like the texture of this volume button
                            vote yes, or no. With this data we could then present the result of this query in a tangible way. Do the majority of the users on the site like this button
                            how old are the people that don't like it. With this information manufacturers can go back to the drawing board and possibly try re-designing this volume button.
                            The site will hopefully create a conversation that does not exist between consumers and manufacturers of goods and products. The site was built using the Mechanical
                            stack. MongoDB, Express, Angular2, and Node.js. The site is hosted on Heroku, and I utilized an old domain I had laying around and pointed its DNS to the Heroku site.
                            The front page of the site is designed to reel in the consumer with its flashy content. The remainder of the site would be a utilizing a design inspired by Google's 
                            Material Design. The site is still a work in progress.
